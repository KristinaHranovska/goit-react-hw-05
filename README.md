# CinemaPulse

CinemaPulse is a web application that allows users to learn about the latest trends in cinema and find desired films, series or cartoons. The project is implemented using React, using data from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

## Functionality

- On the `Home` page, the user can view today's popular movies.
- Clicking on a movie reveals detailed information about it, including `cast` and `reviews`.
- On the `Movies` tab, you can perform a search (find a movie, series, cartoon, etc.).
- Implemented `pagination` for convenient viewing of search results.
- `Notifications` are displayed when the search is empty or there are no results.
- To improve UX, used `react-loader-spinner` to display a spinner while loading content.
- CSS styling is implemented using modular CSS (`.module.css`).

## Technologies used
